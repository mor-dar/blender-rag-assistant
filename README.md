# Blender RAG Assistant

An intelligent documentation assistant for Blender 3D software, built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This project demonstrates advanced agentic AI capabilities for Ready Tensor's Agentic AI Developer Certification Program (Module 1).

## Project Overview

The Blender RAG Assistant transforms the complex Blender documentation into an interactive, intelligent guide that can answer user questions with contextual, cited responses. Unlike simple chatbots, this system retrieves relevant documentation chunks and generates accurate, grounded answers while maintaining proper attribution to source materials.

## Architecture

This RAG system follows a modular, scalable architecture:

```
User Query ‚Üí Query Processing ‚Üí Vector Retrieval ‚Üí Context Assembly ‚Üí LLM Generation ‚Üí Response Formatting
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### RAG Architecture

**Modular Design Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one concern
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between components  
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test coverage with unit and integration tests
- **Professional Structure**: Industry-standard directory organization

### RAG Pipeline

1. **Document Processing** (`src/data/processing/`)
   - `document_processor.py`: HTML parsing and text extraction
   - `vector_builder.py`: Orchestrates end-to-end pipeline
   - Intelligent chunking preserves procedural steps

2. **Vector Operations** (`src/retrieval/`)
   - `embeddings.py`: HuggingFace sentence-transformer interface
   - `vector_store.py`: ChromaDB operations and persistence  
   - `retriever.py`: High-level semantic search API
   - Configurable relevance thresholds and metadata filtering

3. **Retrieval Strategy**
   - Query embedding and similarity matching
   - Context window optimization
   - Health checks and error handling

4. **Response Generation**
   - Context-aware prompt construction
   - LLM reasoning with retrieved knowledge
   - Structured response formatting with citations

### Key Technologies

- **Language Models**: Groq Llama3-8B
- **Embeddings**: HuggingFace sentence-transformers
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB with persistence
- **Framework**: LangChain for orchestration
- **Documentation**: Blender 4.5 Manual (CC-BY-SA 4.0)
